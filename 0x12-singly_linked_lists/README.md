# C - Singly Linked List

Singly-linked lists are widely used in various applications, such as implementing data structures like stacks and queues, representing data sequences, and managing memory dynamically in C.

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (a pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Singly-linked lists are often used in various computer science and programming tasks.

In this repository, several C functions are used for printing, returning the number of elements of a singly linked list, adding new nodes, freeing the list and many more.
