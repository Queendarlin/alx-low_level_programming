C - More Singly Linked List Implementation
This project offers a C implementation of a singly linked list data structure. A singly linked list consists of nodes, each containing a value (n) and a reference to the next node.

The core data structure is defined as follows:

listint_t:
n: an integer (the node's value)
next: a reference to the next node

The project includes various functions to work with singly linked lists, such as calculating the list's length, adding nodes at the beginning or end, and freeing memory.
